        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Wes! I solve problems for my career. But I did not always enjoy facing obstacles everyday.
            It is some thing that I have learned to do. I went to school at Texas A&M and study business (yeah I did
            not quite know what I wanted to do everyday yet. I took a summer job with an oil company that taught me
            what I did not want to do. They company had two developers. Two. They worked on a rig metrics iOS app.
            That is when I said, "I want to write software."</p>

        <p>Engineering software is tough. Quickly, at my first gig I ran into challenge after challenge. And without
            a lot of experience or confidence to fallback on, I soon found myself with a very bruised ego. But while struggling
            with code, people, clients, expectations, I discovered something. I discovered failure produces growth. Analyzing
            conflicts refines character. And arguably best of all, a few defects are not the end of the world.</p>

        <p>See, software has taught me that struggling at something is ok. Sucking at something is the first step to being kind
            of good at something. But is still not easy. But when I look at it growth from server driven, object-oriented apps to
            client-side functionally programmed apps, I begin to see what is possible when someone sees challenges and embrasses
            the hard stuff for what it is.</p>

        <p>I love searching for all the variables of a complex situation to get to the root of why things are the way they are.
            I do this without being conscious of it. Why did this team succeed and this time struggle? What was great about
            his or her leadership? Where can I improve myself so that I can work more effectively with others? It's fun and I
            gravitate towards impactful people and challenges. While I did not know all of this when I started, it is why I enjoy
            dedicating myself to growth everyday.</p>
